          <p id="isPasted">It was move-in day of freshman year at DSU. Alexis and Grant had spent all day moving into their dorm rooms, meeting their roommates, picking up their laptops, and familiarizing themselves with the town. But after some sad goodbyes to their families, it was time for orientation. DSU had split the entire freshman class randomly into groups to play very cheesy ‘get to know you’ games. It just so happened that Alexis and Grant ended up in the same group. They didn’t say much to each other during the games, but afterwards, when everyone got in line for supper, they ended up right next to each other and struck up a conversation. After supper, they exchanged phone numbers and went their separate ways.</p>
          <p>It wasn’t long after that Grant was walking Alexis back to her dorm after the football games that she was a cheerleader for and messaging her all the time. Eventually, she agreed to have supper with him.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: 700;">
              <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">August 28, 2017&nbsp;</span>
            </span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Alexis and Grant’s first date! They had agreed to meet up for supper. Alexis thought they were just going to eat at the cafeteria and catch up, but Grant had other ideas. He took them out to eat at a local sports bar and then they drove out to the state park in Madison and sat by the lake talking for hours. The time flew by and before they knew it, it was time to head back.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: 700;">
              <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">September 17, 2017&nbsp;</span>
            </span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Grant had to coach a little kid’s soccer game in Mitchell and Alexis needed to get something from her house, so she agreed to go with. She spent all day at the soccer fields with him watching him coach soccer. It was a lot of fun. When she went to grab something from in her house, Grant came with and met her parent’s and one set of her grandparents.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
              <span class="u-text-palette-1-base" style="font-weight: 700;">September 18, 2017&nbsp;</span>
            </span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Grant officially asked Alexis to be his girlfriend. It was late at night, and they were texting back and forth about how great of a day they had when Grant finally asked, and Alexis obviously said yes.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
              <span class="u-text-palette-1-base" style="font-weight: 700;">September 19, 2017&nbsp;</span>
            </span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Grant asked Alexis to go to a soccer game in Watertown with him. She didn’t know much about soccer but agreed to go. She doesn’t remember much of the game, but after it was over, they headed to Taco John’s to meet Grant’s parents for supper. She was nervous, but it went great.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
              <span class="u-text-palette-1-base" style="font-weight: 700;">September 2017 - August 2021&nbsp;</span>
            </span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The rest is kind of a blur. They celebrated holidays, birthdays, and anniversaries together. Grant was with Alexis when she lost two of her great-grandparents and a beloved high school friend. They went on vacations together, studied together, graduated college, moved into apartments, got jobs. Through lots of ups and downs they found comfort in each other sharing all the highs and all the lows.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: 700;">
              <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">August 11, 2021&nbsp;</span>
            </span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">A new building was opening at DSU! Grant convinced Alexis that they should go to the grand opening. She did not understand why he wanted to go so badly but agreed to go with. After watching a lot of community members talk about how awesome the building was going to be, Grant took Alexis over to “get his honor’s banner” that he was supposed to get when he graduated. Except, there was no banner. We walked over to the lawn of East Hall where we had met almost exactly 4 years earlier, got down on one knee and asked Alexis to spend forever with him. She said yes immediately. Little did she know, there was a photographer hiding in the bushes. Luckily, Grant’s sister had taken Alexis to get her nails done a few days before. They got some beautiful photos and then headed out to the state park to enjoy being engaged. Grant then told Alexis that her whole family: parents, grandparents, sisters and brother were coming to eat supper with them so they could all celebrate together. Alexis’s dad had kept the secret really well, so no one knew why they were coming to eat in Madison. So, Alexis and Grant got to tell them together!&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">And so the wedding planning began and a date was set: September 10, 2022.&nbsp;</span>
